ðŸ“˜ Bookstore Database SQL Project
This SQL project demonstrates the design and querying of a Bookstore Management System with three core tables: Books, Customers, and Orders. It includes:
Table creation scripts with appropriate keys and constraints
Practical SQL queries for:
Genre-based and year-based book filtering
Customer segmentation by country and spending
Revenue and sales analysis
Inventory tracking and most/least popular items
Joins and aggregations for insightful reports (e.g., most frequent buyers, top authors, city-based spending)
The project showcases key SQL concepts like JOIN, GROUP BY, HAVING, ORDER BY, LIMIT, AGGREGATE FUNCTIONS, and SUBQUERIES
